Hey life..
I am happy because of you.If somebody ask me what is really important in life than I would tell life itself is really important for me.
It gave me a chance to breath,smile,dance,laugh,love and many more...
I have understood the life in a very different way because it just always tried its best to give me the best things such as a very caring family.Now
coming to my family its the best thing happend to me in the whole world . My family not only gave me the food,love,space,education etc more 
than that they thought me life skills such as patience,acceptance,importance and understanding each and everything.I always wish to treat each and
every life of the world to be happy not only external happiness but also internal too.Making the best memories,understanding everybodies situation,
accepting whatever comes to my way.Being a human a most intelligent animal in the whole worlld its our duty to save lifes at the best way.Always
wishing everylife to get the best happiness..
Never trying to hurt any life of the world just being kind to each and everyone and not only for humanbeings but also for all the creatures.
These are the things which are tought by Family and which are always going in my mind.Every life of the world will meet the death one day and for
me that day should need to be most happeist day among everyday.So for that happeist day I just prepare my mind everyday.Preparations before the
exam will make us to score well.So I am preparing for that happeist day so it will become good .But I dont want good marks I need the best marks.
So I wish only happiness ,love for everyone...
